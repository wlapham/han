# Han Release Notes

## v2.5.0

A new `/research` skill and its `research-analyst` agent ship, taking the catalog to 19 skills and 22 agents. `/coding-standard` now writes its output as path-scoped Claude Code rules under `.claude/rules/` rather than a freestanding document, and the same path-scoped-rules pattern is applied repo-wide so contributor guidance under `docs/guidance/` reaches Claude Code automatically. A GitHub pull request template lands with a review checklist that hands off to `/update-pr-description`, and the README drops its duplicated skills list in favor of the canonical catalog under `docs/skills/`.

### New skill

`/research` answers open-ended questions (options, prior art, trade-offs, how something works) and produces a durable, evidence-backed, adversarially-validated report that recommends an option without committing the team to any artifact. It reaches the codebase, the open web, and any material the operator provides, and ships with `plugin/skills/research/SKILL.md` and a fixed report structure rendered from `plugin/skills/research/references/research-report-template.md`. The skill operates in an evidence mode that forces every recommendation to carry traceable citations (decision D23), and the report layout is fixed rather than freeform (decision D24). YAGNI is intentionally not applied inside `/research` or `research-analyst`: research surfaces options the operator may or may not pursue, so the deferral rule that gates planning and review skills would cut signal rather than noise. `/research` is the question-shaped sibling of `/investigate`: `/investigate` diagnoses a known failure, `/research` surveys an open question. Neighbor routing is wired bidirectionally across `/architectural-analysis`, `/gap-analysis`, `/investigate`, and `/plan-a-feature`, and the long-form catalog at `docs/skills/research.md` documents when to reach for it. (PR #8)

### New agent

`research-analyst` is the specialist `/research` dispatches for codebase, web, and operator-supplied evidence gathering. It ships at `plugin/agents/research-analyst.md` with a long-form doc at `docs/agents/research-analyst.md`, and is cross-referenced from every neighboring agent's "Related Documentation" section. (PR #8)

### Coding standards as path-scoped rules

`/coding-standard` now writes its output as a path-scoped Claude Code rule under `.claude/rules/` and symlinks the canonical document from `docs/` rather than producing a standalone markdown file. `plugin/skills/coding-standard/SKILL.md` and `plugin/skills/coding-standard/references/template.md` are updated to the new output contract, and `docs/skills/coding-standard.md` documents the canonical-doc + rules-symlink layout in plain language so operators can read the rule in either location. A step-count error in the operator doc is fixed in the same pass. (PR #9)

### Contributor guidance as Claude Code rules

A new `.claude/rules/` directory contains roughly 28 symlinks mirroring `docs/guidance/skill-building-guidance/*.md`, `docs/guidance/agent-building-guidelines/*.md`, and `docs/guidance/plugin-entity-taxonomy.md`. Path-scoped rules let Claude Code load the relevant guidance automatically when an operator edits a skill or agent under `plugin/`, so contributor conventions reach the model without the operator pasting them into context.

### Pull request template

`.github/pull_request_template.md` adds a review checklist for new pull requests against the Han repo and hands off to `/update-pr-description` for generating the body. The template is internal to this repository and does not change plugin behavior.

### Documentation

- `README.md`: the duplicated skills list is removed; the canonical catalog at `docs/skills/README.md` is now the single source.
- `CLAUDE.md`: project map updated for the 19-skill, 22-agent counts and the new `/research` entry.
- `docs/concepts.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/sizing.md`: cross-reference updates for `/research`.
- All 22 long-form agent docs under `docs/agents/` and 18 long-form skill docs under `docs/skills/` gain neighbor-routing entries pointing at `/research` and `research-analyst` where the relationship is real.
- `plugin/agents/adversarial-validator.md` is updated alongside the cross-skill cross-referencing pass.

## v2.4.0

Three new plugin skills ship, taking the catalog from 15 to 18: `/issue-triage` for turning a vague report into a structured triage document, `/tdd` for a BDD-framed red-green-refactor loop, and `/plan-work-items` for breaking a trusted implementation plan into grabbable work items. `/architectural-analysis` is rebuilt as the sixth sizing-aware swarming skill, and three synthesis agents move to the opus tier so their shipped frontmatter matches the documented design intent.

### New skills

- `/issue-triage` classifies a vague issue or bug report into a structured document covering issue type, missing information, severity, reproducibility, and the recommended next han skill. Single pass, no sub-agents. (PR #5)
- `/tdd` drives a feature or behavior through a BDD-framed red-green-refactor loop with an enforced observed-failure gate. It is the plugin's only execution skill: it writes code, applies coding standards and ADRs during green and refactor, enforces YAGNI during refactor, and ships a `plugin/skills/tdd/scripts/detect-tdd-context.sh` discovery script. It runs autonomously after the initial request. (PR #7)
- `/plan-work-items` breaks a trusted implementation plan into independently-grabbable, atomic work items in a single `work-items.md` file, dispatching `project-manager` once and running autonomously without confirmation gates. (PR #2) The skill was developed under the working name `implementation-plan-to-issues` and renamed to `plan-work-items` before it ever shipped, so there is no breaking rename for v2.3.0 users.

### Architectural analysis rebuild

`/architectural-analysis` is rebuilt as a signal-selected, sizing-aware agent swarm. A synthesis spine (`structural-analyst`, `behavioral-analyst`, `risk-analyst`, `software-architect`) always runs; signal-selected specialists (`concurrency-analyst`, `adversarial-security-analyst`, `data-engineer`, `devops-engineer`, `codebase-explorer`, `system-architect`) are added by signal and size band; and the report is rendered from an extracted `plugin/skills/architectural-analysis/references/architectural-analysis-report-template.md`. This makes it the sixth sizing-aware swarming skill alongside `/code-review`, `/gap-analysis`, `/iterative-plan-review`, `/plan-a-feature`, and `/plan-implementation`, and the shared sizing docs are updated to register it. (PR #6)

### Agent model tiers

`junior-developer`, `information-architect`, and `user-experience-designer` move from `model: sonnet` to `model: opus` in their agent frontmatter. All three perform synthesis over unbounded input, and `docs/guidance/specialization-and-model-selection.md` already listed them under "Keep opus" with an opus rationale in their long-form docs, but their frontmatter had shipped as `sonnet` since the initial repo extraction. This aligns the implementation with the documented design intent. It is a real behavior and cost change whenever any of these three agents is dispatched.

### Documentation

- [`docs/skills/issue-triage.md`](./docs/skills/issue-triage.md): output-contract block now mirrors `plugin/skills/issue-triage/references/template.md` (an H1 summary title with H2 section headers), and the cost-and-latency note now reflects that the skill reads both `CLAUDE.md` and `project-discovery.md` to sharpen Suspected Areas.
- [`docs/skills/plan-work-items.md`](./docs/skills/plan-work-items.md): adds the missing `reference-artifact-inventory.md` link.
- `README.md`: the "Maintenance" heading typo is fixed.
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: descriptions synced; they now mention planning and issue triage.
- `CLAUDE.md`: the "Current version" line is corrected.

### Repository tooling

- A repo-maintenance skill `/han-release` is added at `.claude/skills/han-release/` for cutting Han releases. It is internal to this repository and is not one of the 18 shipped plugin skills.

### Pull requests in this release

- Add /issue-triage skill (#5) — @spken
- Rebuild architectural-analysis skill: sizing-aware agent swarm (#6) — @mxriverlynn
- Add a /tdd skill (#7) — @mxriverlynn

Full changelog: https://github.com/testdouble/han/blob/v2.4.0/CHANGELOG.md#v240

## v2.3.0

The `/code-review` skill is recalibrated so its first pass produces the output the user has been getting only by running a manual second-pass reclassification: severity inflation is removed at the structural level, user-provided focus areas and branch-level context reach every dispatched sub-agent, and contradictory same-file findings are detected internally rather than landing for the human to adjudicate without a flag.

### Calibration

- The agent-finding classification rubric in `plugin/skills/code-review/references/agent-finding-classification.md` no longer carries a "Most findings land here" WARN floor across seven of the nine agent rubrics. The rubric defines each severity; size-based demotion is governed by `SKILL.md` Step 3.3, the new authoritative home.
- `SKILL.md` Step 3.3 is now the single source of truth for size-based demotion. The Review Constraints rule for manual findings (line 24), the Step 7.2 demotion gate for agent findings, the size-aware rubric, and the YAGNI two-pass procedure all reference Step 3.3 by name rather than restating its content.
- `SKILL.md` Step 7 is restructured into three numbered sub-steps. 7.1 reads agent output; 7.2 applies the merged reachability phrase-match demotion gate (CRIT → WARN → SUGG → omitted) when a finding's rationale contains `theoretical`, `hypothetical`, `defense-in-depth`, `effectively impossible`, `in case the upstream`, `could happen`, `should never happen`, or `edge case that does not occur`; 7.3 classifies the surviving findings using the size-aware rubric. Security findings are exempt from the gate because the security agent's evidence standard already requires a demonstrated exploit path.

### Context plumbing

- New `Step 1.5: Load Branch Context` runs after Step 1 (Mode A and Mode B only). It attempts the PR description via `gh pr view`, local `pr-body` files, branch commit messages, and an implementation plan from the planning directory (resolved via the `plans:` key in CLAUDE.md or by Glob fallback). The loaded summary binds to `$branch_context`. When nothing loads, the skill warns once and binds `$branch_context` to `none provided`.
- `$focus_areas` and `$branch_context` are explicit named bindings. Step 1 binds the user's free-form argument to `$focus_areas` (defaulting to `none provided` when empty); Step 1.5 binds the loader output to `$branch_context`. Every Step 3.5 agent prompt includes both bindings verbatim so the agents can deprioritize work the team has already deferred or resolved.
- `Bash(gh *)` is added to the skill's `allowed-tools` frontmatter so Step 1.5 can call `gh pr view`.

### Per-agent dispatcher tailoring at Step 3.5

- `structural-analyst` and `behavioral-analyst` receive a default-SUGG dispatcher directive: every finding starts at SUGG; escalation to WARN or CRIT requires the change to actively introduce or worsen the issue. The agents' general behavior outside `/code-review` is unchanged.
- `junior-developer` receives a file-list scoping directive: outward reads are for context only; findings must concern code on the scoped file list. The agents' general behavior outside `/code-review` is unchanged.
- `edge-case-explorer` receives a narrower file-list directive that preserves Protocol 1's caller-read pattern: callers can be read as evidence, but the failure-mode target of every finding stays on the file list.

### YAGNI two-pass procedure

- `references/review-checklist.md`, the Step 3.3 calibration directive's YAGNI block, and the Review Constraints YAGNI rule are all rewritten to run YAGNI in two passes: Pass 1 evidence test against `yagni-rule.md` Gate 1, then Pass 2 named anti-pattern match. Each YAGNI finding's body names the failing evidence type, the matched anti-pattern, and the simpler form considered. The YAGNI section's verbatim opening statement is preserved.
- In Mode B (uncommitted changes) and Mode C (no git), the YAGNI checklist is skipped unless the user explicitly requests it via `$focus_areas`, since the diff signal that separates introduced code from pre-existing code is absent.

### Self-consistency check

- New `Step 9.0: Self-consistency check` runs before structural verification. An extraction pass collects `{task-id, file-path, line-range, recommended-action-summary}` tuples for every finding, then a comparison pass flags overlapping-line-range pairs whose recommendations prescribe opposite actions on the same code. Both findings are demoted by one severity and each receives a `Tension with {other-task-id}:` note for the human reviewer. Cross-file semantic contradictions are out of scope.

### Premise verification before standards-compliance findings

- Step 5 now requires reading at least one architectural file in the codebase that demonstrates a standard's premise before raising a "violates standard X" finding. When the file does not confirm the premise (e.g., the standard assumes SPA-style company switching but the codebase uses full-page redirects), the finding is omitted with a logged note. The "infer the premise from the standard's own examples" path is now a reason to omit, not a forward path to raise.

### Documentation

- [`docs/skills/code-review.md`](./docs/skills/code-review.md) is updated to mirror the new step structure (Step 1.5, the Step 7 sub-steps, Step 9.0), the per-agent dispatcher tailoring, the size-based demotion model, the YAGNI two-pass procedure, the full agent task ID format set, and the new YAGNI section in the output description.
- The four affected agent docs ([`docs/agents/structural-analyst.md`](./docs/agents/structural-analyst.md), [`docs/agents/behavioral-analyst.md`](./docs/agents/behavioral-analyst.md), [`docs/agents/junior-developer.md`](./docs/agents/junior-developer.md), [`docs/agents/edge-case-explorer.md`](./docs/agents/edge-case-explorer.md)) each carry a one-paragraph note explaining the `/code-review` Step 3.5 dispatcher tailoring and confirming the agents' default behavior in other skills is unchanged.
- [`docs/yagni.md`](./docs/yagni.md) `/code-review` table row is updated to reflect the two-pass procedure and the Mode B / Mode C YAGNI skip.
- [`docs/skills/gh-pr-review.md`](./docs/skills/gh-pr-review.md) gains a Key Concept noting that the wrapped `/code-review` Step 1.5 plumbs the PR description into every agent's `$branch_context`.

### Deferred (YAGNI)

- A dedicated S12 mode flag for default-SUGG suppression is deferred. The size-aware rubric (Pair A) plus the merged Step 7.2 demotion gate (Pair B) plus the rewritten Review Constraints rule subsume the workaround the user has been running manually.
- A structured "directly introduced" field in agent output formats is deferred in favor of phrase-matching at Step 7.2.
- Cross-file semantic contradiction detection in Step 9.0 is deferred; only single-file overlapping-line-range contradictions are checked.
- An automated test harness, per-agent unit tests, and Mode C standalone tests are deferred.
- Edits to the four affected agent definition files are deferred; `/code-review`'s tailoring lives in Step 3.5 dispatcher directives so the agents remain general-purpose for other callers.

## v2.2.0

The `/gap-analysis` swarm flips from opt-in to opt-out, `junior-developer` is promoted to a required swarm role at every size to run an explicit actor-perspective sweep, and `project-manager` joins the swarm at medium and large to consolidate Section 4 of the report.

### Default-on swarm

The validator-and-augmenter swarm now runs by default at every size. Reply `no swarm` to opt out and fall back to the lightweight gap-analyzer-only pass; reply `lightweight` to drop to the minimum two required roles without domain specialists.

- **Small** *(default)*: 2–3 agents — `adversarial-validator` and `junior-developer` always, plus `evidence-based-investigator` when the current state is concrete. No PM at small.
- **Medium**: 4–6 agents — the required three plus 1–2 domain specialists plus `project-manager` for Section 4 synthesis.
- **Large**: 6–8 agents — the required three plus 2–4 domain specialists plus `project-manager`.

### Actor-perspective sweep

`junior-developer` is now a required swarm member at every size. Its job in `/gap-analysis` is to enumerate every actor the desired state addresses or implies (human end users and sub-roles, API callers, AI agents, integration partners, batch processes, internal services), check whether each gap holds for every actor type, and surface gaps the analyzer missed because it only considered one actor.

### Conditional second round

When the first-round swarm surfaces ≥ 3 `proposed_new_gap` entries (Trigger A) or contradictions on ≥ 20% of the analyzer's original gaps (Trigger B), the skill runs one additional `gap-analyzer` pass with the new actor context and merges the delta into the source file. Bounded to one extra round.

### Section 4 default-on; augmentations inline into Section 2

Section 4 (Swarm Findings) is now rendered by default and is omitted only when the user passed `no swarm`. Swarm augmentations (added risks, secondary effects, refined framing, actor-perspective notes from `junior-developer`) inline into Section 2 entries as `Additional context (swarm):` lines so they land where the gap lives, while Section 4 retains the audit-trail listing.

### Documentation

- [`docs/skills/gap-analysis.md`](./docs/skills/gap-analysis.md) — updated TL;DR, key concepts, sizing table, cost-and-latency model, "In more detail" section, and Sources / Related Documentation to reflect the opt-out posture.
- Cross-references updated in [`docs/concepts.md`](./docs/concepts.md), [`docs/quickstart.md`](./docs/quickstart.md), [`docs/sizing.md`](./docs/sizing.md), [`docs/skills/README.md`](./docs/skills/README.md), and the agent docs for `adversarial-validator`, `evidence-based-investigator`, `junior-developer`, `project-manager`, and `gap-analyzer`.

## v2.0.1

The "this codebase is a startup" framing is removed from the YAGNI rule and every skill and agent that inherits it. The evidence-based YAGNI mechanic is unchanged — only the rationale prose is reframed so the rule reads as project-agnostic guidance rather than advice contingent on company stage.

Affected files: `docs/yagni.md`, `references/yagni-rule.md`, the `project-manager` and `junior-developer` agents, and the `iterative-plan-review`, `plan-a-feature`, `plan-a-phased-build`, `plan-implementation`, and `test-planning` skills. Every removal preserves the surrounding "every X is ongoing maintenance and a pattern future agents will copy" sentence that does the actual work.

## v2.0.0

Two skills are renamed and a YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) discipline is woven through the planning, review, and architecture skills and agents.

### Breaking changes

Two skills have been renamed. Update any scripts, slash-command invocations, agent prompts, or documentation that referenced the old names.

| Old name | New name |
| --- | --- |
| `han:gh-pr-description` | `han:update-pr-description` |
| `han:create-adr` | `han:architectural-decision-record` |

The skill behavior is unchanged — only the names and their on-disk directories. Old names will not resolve; the slash commands are now `/update-pr-description` and `/architectural-decision-record`.

### YAGNI evidence requirements across planning, review, and architecture

Every place where the plugin proposes new code, new tests, new infrastructure, or new abstractions now requires concrete evidence that the work is needed today — not speculation about the future. Added to:

- Planning skills: `/plan-a-feature`, `/plan-implementation`, `/plan-a-phased-build`, `/iterative-plan-review`
- Review and standards: `/code-review` (advisory-only), `/coding-standard`, `/test-planning`, `/architectural-decision-record` (forcing-function requirement)
- Agents: `project-manager`, `junior-developer`, `software-architect`, `system-architect`, `test-engineer`, `edge-case-explorer`, `data-engineer`, `devops-engineer`

Each skill or agent applies the rule to its own surface area — speculative tests, premature operational machinery, speculative data machinery, speculative edge cases, abstractions without a forcing function, and so on. Plans now include a **Deferred** section to capture explicitly-rejected speculative work.

## v1.7.0

Filename naming for `/coding-standard` and `/architectural-decision-record` outputs changes from a timestamp prefix to a discovered, hierarchical prefix so related documents sort together.

### Hierarchical filenames for coding standards and ADRs

Both skills replace the `{YYYYMMDDHHmmss}-{name}.md` pattern with `{top-level}[-{second-level}]-{name}.md`.

- The hierarchy prefix is one or two levels (e.g., `svelte-stores-state-shape.md`, `auth-tokens-rotation.md`).
- The taxonomy is **discovered at runtime**, not hardcoded — both skills parse existing standards/ADRs in the project's directory and read CLAUDE.md / project-discovery.md to identify the project's languages, frameworks, runtimes, subsystems, and bounded contexts as candidate top-level prefixes.
- When existing prefixes fit, they are reused; new top-levels are introduced only when nothing existing applies.
- When the discovered taxonomy offers more than one reasonable placement, the skill asks the user before writing.
- The unused `Bash(date *)` permission has been dropped from both skills' `allowed-tools`.

### Documentation

- [`docs/skills/coding-standard.md`](./docs/skills/coding-standard.md) and [`docs/skills/architectural-decision-record.md`](./docs/skills/architectural-decision-record.md) updated to describe the hierarchical filename pattern, the discovery step, and the new shape of the produced filename.

## v1.6.1

Sizing becomes a foundational dispatch lever across the swarming skills.

### Size-aware code-review agent dispatch

`/code-review` now classifies the change as small / medium / large before dispatching agents, defaults to small, and scales the roster proportionally.

- Two agents always run on every review: `junior-developer` and `adversarial-security-analyst`.
- The rest of the roster — `test-engineer`, `edge-case-explorer`, `structural-analyst`, `behavioral-analyst`, `concurrency-analyst`, `data-engineer`, `devops-engineer` — is dispatched conditionally based on what the changed files actually touch.
- Every agent brief carries a calibration directive that requires findings to be either introduced/worsened by the change or critical irrespective of who introduced it. Severity scales with size.
- `data-engineer` and `devops-engineer` join the conditional roster with finding-classification rubrics for data-side and operational concerns.

### Cross-skill `$size` argument

All five sizing-aware skills — `/code-review`, `/gap-analysis`, `/iterative-plan-review`, `/plan-a-feature`, `/plan-implementation` — now declare a positional `size` argument in their frontmatter per the Claude Code skills spec.

- Pass `small`, `medium`, or `large` as the first positional argument to override the auto-classification: `/code-review medium`, `/plan-a-feature large "describe the feature"`, etc.
- When `$size` is non-empty, the skill uses that value as the size and scales its team / swarm caps and finding calibration accordingly.
- Without `$size`, the skill auto-classifies from concrete signals (file count, subsystems touched, security/data/integration surface).

### Default to small across all sizing-aware skills

Every sizing-aware skill now starts the classification at small and only escalates when concrete signals clearly require it. Borderline signals stay at the smaller band — fewer agents producing higher-signal findings is the goal.

### New sizing reference doc

[`docs/sizing.md`](./docs/sizing.md) is the canonical cross-skill sizing reference.

- The three bands (small / medium / large) and what they mean.
- The auto-classification process and the `$size` override.
- A per-skill at-a-glance table covering all five sizing-aware skills.
- Cross-references in every sizing-aware skill's long-form doc back to the reference and vice versa.
- Discoverable from the front-door `README.md`, `docs/concepts.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, and `docs/skills/README.md`.

### Documentation refreshes

- `docs/skills/code-review.md` — refreshed for the size-aware dispatch model (was still describing the old "six agents always run" shape).
- New **Sizing** section in each of `docs/skills/code-review.md`, `docs/skills/gap-analysis.md`, `docs/skills/iterative-plan-review.md`, `docs/skills/plan-a-feature.md`, `docs/skills/plan-implementation.md`.
- `docs/concepts.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/skills/README.md`, and `docs/skills/gh-pr-review.md` updated to reflect the new code-review roster shape.

## v1.6.0

Two new skills land in the `han` plugin, both producing plain-language reports that stakeholders (not just engineers) can read.

### `/gap-analysis` — compare two artifacts and find what's missing

Run a gap analysis between a *current state* and a *desired state* — for example a PRD vs. the shipped feature, a spec vs. its implementation, or any "what's missing from X compared to Y" question.

- Delegates the heavy analysis to the `gap-analyzer` agent, then synthesizes a stakeholder-readable report indexed by stable `G-NNN` gap IDs.
- Default output is plain language only — no file paths, line numbers, or code references in the main sections. Technical detail is opt-in.
- Optionally launches a swarm of validator/augmenter agents to corroborate or enrich findings. Swarm size (small / medium / large) is recommended based on gap count and category mix, but it never runs without the user opting in.
- Ships with a report template (`references/gap-analysis-report-template.md`) designed by the `information-architect` agent.

See [`/gap-analysis` documentation](./docs/skills/gap-analysis.md).

### `/plan-a-phased-build` — turn context into a sequenced build plan

Take any source of context (a gap analysis, PRD, design doc, feature spec, conversation notes, ADR, etc.) and produce a `build-phase-outline.md` that splits the work into vertical-slice phases.

- Every phase is **demonstrable to a real person** end-to-end — not "we shipped a service" but "you can do X and Y happens".
- Phases sequence for earliest demoable value. Foundational/prerequisite phases only come first when dependencies actually require it.
- Plain-language throughout: product-level subsystem names, user-facing vocabulary, behavioral verbs. A non-technical stakeholder can read it cover to cover.
- Each phase cross-references back to the source artifact for traceability.
- The `information-architect` agent reviews the rendered document for findability and progressive comprehension.

See [`/plan-a-phased-build` documentation](./docs/skills/plan-a-phased-build.md).

### Documentation

- New skill docs: [`gap-analysis.md`](./docs/skills/gap-analysis.md), [`plan-a-phased-build.md`](./docs/skills/plan-a-phased-build.md)
- [Skills Index](./docs/skills/README.md) and [Quickstart](./docs/quickstart.md) updated to surface both
- Minor link/version touch-ups across existing skill docs
