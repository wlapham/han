# han: Project Map

Han is a Claude Code plugin suite for solo (or small-team) product engineers. It packages evidence-based planning, deep code review, investigation, and documentation workflows into deterministic slash commands that dispatch specialist sub-agents to do the judgment-heavy work. The suite ships as a family of plugins: `han-core` (the research, analysis, documentation, and operations skills plus all the agents the rest of the suite dispatches), `han-planning` (the planning skills you reach for before implementation: specifying with `plan-a-feature`, planning the build with `plan-implementation`, sequencing it with `plan-a-phased-build`, breaking it into work with `plan-work-items`, and stress-testing plans with `iterative-plan-review`; depends on `han-core` and is bundled by the `han` meta-plugin), `han-coding` (the coding skills you reach for while working in code: writing it with `tdd` and `refactor`, plus reviewing, overviewing, analyzing, testing, investigating, and standardizing it with `code-review`, `code-overview`, `architectural-analysis`, `test-planning`, `investigate`, and `coding-standard`; depends on `han-core` and is bundled by the `han` meta-plugin), `han-github` (GitHub-facing skills), `han-reporting` (reporting and summary skills), `han` (a meta-plugin that installs `han-core`, `han-planning`, `han-coding`, `han-github`, and `han-reporting` via dependencies), `han-feedback` (an opt-in plugin carrying the post-session feedback skill, which depends on `han-core` but is deliberately *not* bundled by the `han` meta-plugin, so it is installed separately), `han-atlassian` (an opt-in plugin carrying the Atlassian skills — Confluence publishing and work-items-to-Jira — which depends on `han-core`, `han-planning`, and `han-coding` because its wrapper skills run skills from each, requires a configured Atlassian MCP server, and is likewise *not* bundled by the `han` meta-plugin), `han-linear` (an opt-in plugin carrying the work-items-to-Linear skill, which depends on `han-core`, requires a configured Linear MCP server, and is likewise *not* bundled by the `han` meta-plugin), and `han-plugin-builder` (an opt-in plugin carrying the guidance for building skills and plugins, plus the interview-driven `skill-builder` and `agent-builder` skills that author a new skill or agent from scratch and review it against that guidance; it depends on nothing and is also deliberately *not* bundled by the `han` meta-plugin).

## Creating skills, agents, or other plugin aspects

All skill creation, agent definitions, and other plugin assets must use the appropriate [han-plugin-builder guidance](./han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/) markdown files,
and / or the appropriate han-plugin-builder skill:

* `/han-plugin-builder:skill-builder` for building skills
* `/han-plugin-builder:agent-builder` for building agents
* `/han-plugin-builder:guidance` for all other plugin aspects

The plugins are shipped from `han-core/`, `han-planning/`, `han-coding/`, `han-github/`, `han-reporting/`, `han-feedback/`, `han-atlassian/`, `han-linear/`, and `han-plugin-builder/`; the `han/` meta-plugin pulls in `han-core`, `han-planning`, `han-coding`, `han-github`, and `han-reporting` through its `dependencies`. `han-planning` and `han-coding` depend on `han-core` like the GitHub and reporting layers and are bundled by the meta-plugin. `han-feedback`, `han-atlassian`, and `han-linear` depend on `han-core` like the other layers but are deliberately left out of the meta-plugin, so each is opt-in and installed on its own (`han-atlassian` additionally requires a configured Atlassian MCP server, and `han-linear` a configured Linear MCP server). `han-plugin-builder` depends on nothing and is likewise opt-in and installed on its own. The contributor-facing authoring guidance (how to build skills, agents, and plugins) lives inside `han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/`, not under `docs/`; running the `guidance` skill with `init` vendors all three plugin-building skills into any repo's `.claude/skills/` under a `plugin-` prefix (`plugin-guidance`, `plugin-skill-builder`, and `plugin-agent-builder`, so they never collide with this plugin's own slash commands), plus a path-scoped rule index, so the skills run and the guidance surfaces with no dependency on the plugin being installed. The same plugin also ships those two interview-driven builder skills, `skill-builder` and `agent-builder`, that walk the design tree for a new skill or agent decision-by-decision and then review the finished artifact against that guidance. Documentation lives in `docs/` and covers the whole suite. Long-form docs in `docs/skills/{plugin}/{name}.md` and `docs/agents/han-core/{name}.md` are the canonical operator-facing source for every skill and every agent. The underlying definition (`han-core/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-planning/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-coding/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-reporting/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-feedback/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-atlassian/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, `han-linear/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, or `han-core/agents/{name}.md`) is the implementation.

## When to use which doc

This section does not need to list docs for all the skills, agents, etc. Only docs that are relevant to using an agent such as Claude, shnould be referenced here.

### Entry points

- **[README.md](./README.md).** End-user landing page. Use to understand what the plugin is and where to start. Lists install instructions and pointers to every other doc.
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).** Contributor guide for adding or editing skills, agents, and documentation. Read before changing any file under `han-core/`, `han-github/`, or `docs/`.
- **[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).** Version history. Check when a behavior or skill name in user-supplied context doesn't match what's on disk. May be a pre-2.0 rename or a removed feature.

### Writing voice

- **[han-core/references/writing-voice.md](./han-core/references/writing-voice.md).** Voice profile every doc in the plugin follows. No em-dashes, direct second person, plainspoken mentor tone, named voice violations to avoid. Canonical copy in `han-core/references/`; vendored byte-identical into `han-coding/`, `han-github/`, and `han-reporting/` references so it ships with each plugin.

### Templates (`docs/templates/`)

- **[docs/templates/skill-long-form-template.md](./docs/templates/skill-long-form-template.md).** Template for a new skill's long-form doc.
- **[docs/templates/agent-long-form-template.md](./docs/templates/agent-long-form-template.md).** Template for a new agent's long-form doc.
- **[docs/templates/coverage-rule.md](./docs/templates/coverage-rule.md).** The rule: every skill and every agent gets a long-form doc.

## Conventions

- **One canonical source per concept.** The long-form doc in `docs/skills/` or `docs/agents/` is canonical for that skill or agent. Index entries carry one-sentence scent plus a link. The README never duplicates long-form content.
- **Every long-form doc links up.** The first bullet of the "Related Documentation" section always points back to the README at the repo root.
- **Voice is uniform.** Every doc follows [han-core/references/writing-voice.md](./han-core/references/writing-voice.md). No em-dashes, direct second person, no flattery or hype.
- **YAGNI applies to docs too.** Don't add speculative sections, for-future-flexibility warnings, or examples for behavior the skill doesn't have. The same evidence rule that gates plan steps gates docs.
- **Indexes stay complete, not counted.** Every skill in `han-core/skills/`, `han-planning/skills/`, `han-coding/skills/`, `han-github/skills/`, `han-reporting/skills/`, `han-feedback/skills/`, `han-atlassian/skills/`, `han-linear/skills/`, and `han-plugin-builder/skills/` has a long-form doc in `docs/skills/` and an entry in the skills index; same for agents in `han-core/agents/` and `docs/agents/`. Verify the indexes list every entity when editing them, rather than tracking a running total.
