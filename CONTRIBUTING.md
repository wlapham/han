# Contributing to han

This page is for contributors: anyone adding, editing, or restructuring skills, agents, or documentation in the han plugin. If you just want to use the plugin, start with the [Plugin landing page](./README.md) or the [Quickstart](./docs/quickstart.md).

> See also: [Plugin landing page](./README.md) · [Concepts](./docs/concepts.md) · [Sizing](./docs/sizing.md) · [YAGNI](./docs/yagni.md) · [Evidence](./docs/evidence.md) · [Readability](./docs/readability.md)

## TL;DR

- Skills ship from the plugin that matches what they do: [`han-core/skills/`](./han-core/skills/) (research, analysis, documentation, operations), [`han-planning/skills/`](./han-planning/skills/) (specifying, planning, sequencing, breaking down, and stress-testing work before implementation), [`han-coding/skills/`](./han-coding/skills/) (writing, reviewing, analyzing, testing, investigating, and standardizing code), [`han-github/skills/`](./han-github/skills/) (GitHub-facing), [`han-reporting/skills/`](./han-reporting/skills/) (stakeholder reporting), [`han-atlassian/skills/`](./han-atlassian/skills/) (publishing to Confluence and Jira), [`han-linear/skills/`](./han-linear/skills/) (publishing to Linear), or [`han-feedback/skills/`](./han-feedback/skills/) (feedback on Han itself); the contributor authoring guidance lives in [`han-plugin-builder/skills/`](./han-plugin-builder/skills/). All agents live in [`han-core/agents/{name}.md`](./han-core/agents/). See [Which plugin does the change belong in?](#which-plugin-does-the-change-belong-in) before you start.
- Long-form docs (for humans deciding *when* and *how* to use a skill or agent) live in `docs/skills/{plugin}/{name}.md` and `docs/agents/han-core/{name}.md`.
- **Every skill and every agent gets a long-form doc.** No exceptions. See the [coverage rule](./docs/templates/coverage-rule.md).
- Use the [long-form skill template](./docs/templates/skill-long-form-template.md) or the [agent template](./docs/templates/agent-long-form-template.md).
- The root [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) carries the at-a-glance project map for assistants and contributors.

## Before you start

Read these once:

- **[`han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/plugin-entity-taxonomy.md`](./han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/plugin-entity-taxonomy.md).** What a skill is, what an agent is, what a hook is, and which to reach for.
- **[`han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/skill-building-guidance/`](./han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/skill-building-guidance/).** The skill-authoring rules: description frontmatter, progressive disclosure, context hygiene, dynamic project discovery, bash permissions, script execution.
- **[`han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/agent-building-guidelines/`](./han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/agent-building-guidelines/).** The agent-authoring rules: external files, model selection, domain focus, graceful degradation, multi-agent economics.
- **[Root `CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).** Repo conventions, doc map, and where each kind of file lives.

## Which plugin does the change belong in?

Han ships as a family of plugins. Most carry components; the `han` meta-plugin bundles the others. Decide where your change goes before you scaffold anything. (For the user-facing version of this map, see [Choosing a Han plugin](./docs/choosing-a-han-plugin.md).)

- **`han-core`** carries the research, analysis, documentation, and operations skills, plus **every agent in the suite**. Agents always go here. A skill goes here when its job is research, analysis, documentation, or capturing operational knowledge, and it needs no external service.
- **`han-planning`** carries the planning skills (`plan-a-feature`, `plan-implementation`, `plan-a-phased-build`, `plan-work-items`, `iterative-plan-review`). A skill goes here when its job is specifying what a feature does, planning how to build it, sequencing the build, breaking it into work, or stress-testing a plan before implementation. It depends on `han-core` and is bundled by the `han` meta-plugin.
- **`han-coding`** carries the coding skills (`tdd`, `refactor`, `code-review`, `code-overview`, `architectural-analysis`, `test-planning`, `investigate`, `coding-standard`). A skill goes here when its job is working directly in code: writing it, reviewing it, analyzing it, testing it, investigating it, or standardizing it. It depends on `han-core` and is bundled by the `han` meta-plugin.
- **`han-github`** carries the GitHub-facing skills (`post-code-review-to-pr`, `update-pr-description`, `work-items-to-issues`). A skill goes here when it reads from or writes to GitHub through the `gh` CLI.
- **`han-reporting`** carries the stakeholder-reporting skills (`stakeholder-summary`, `html-summary`). A skill goes here when its output is a report for a non-technical or executive audience rather than an engineering artifact.
- **`han-feedback`** carries the single `han-feedback` skill. A skill goes here only when it captures feedback on the Han suite itself.
- **`han-atlassian`** carries the Atlassian-facing skills (`markdown-to-confluence`, `project-documentation-to-confluence`, `investigate-to-confluence`, `code-overview-to-confluence`, `plan-a-feature-to-confluence`, `work-items-to-jira`). A skill goes here when it publishes a Han artifact to Confluence or Jira through the Atlassian MCP server. It is opt-in, requires a configured Atlassian MCP server, and depends on `han-core`, `han-planning`, and `han-coding` because its wrapper skills run skills from each.
- **`han-linear`** carries the single `work-items-to-linear` skill. A skill goes here when it publishes Han work items to Linear through the Linear MCP server. It is opt-in, requires a configured Linear MCP server, and depends on `han-core`.
- **`han-plugin-builder`** carries the contributor authoring guidance (the `guidance` skill and its reference set, plus the interview-driven `skill-builder` and `agent-builder` skills). It is opt-in and depends on nothing. Edit it when you change how skills, agents, or plugins are built; it is not where product-facing skills go.
- **`han`** is the meta-plugin. It has no components of its own; it depends on `han-core`, `han-planning`, `han-coding`, `han-github`, and `han-reporting` so one install pulls them all in. `han-feedback`, `han-atlassian`, `han-linear`, and `han-plugin-builder` are deliberately left out so they stay opt-in. You add a component to `han` only by adding it to one of the child plugins; you never put a skill or agent directly in `han`.

Two rules keep the dependency direction clean:

- **Every plugin depends on `han-core`,** so a skill in `han-planning`, `han-coding`, `han-github`, `han-reporting`, or `han-feedback` may dispatch any `han-core` agent freely. That is why all agents live in `han-core`.
- **`han-core` depends on nothing in the other plugins.** A `han-core` skill must not reach for a skill or agent that ships only in `han-planning`, `han-coding`, `han-github`, `han-reporting`, or `han-feedback`. If a core skill needs that capability, the capability belongs in `han-core`.

When a change adds, removes, or moves a skill between plugins, update the marketplace registry at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) so the plugin's component set stays accurate. Long-form docs always live under `docs/` regardless of which plugin the entity ships in.

## Adding a skill

1. Decide the plugin using [Which plugin does the change belong in?](#which-plugin-does-the-change-belong-in) above, then scaffold the folder under that plugin's `skills/{name}/` directory (`han-core`, `han-planning`, `han-coding`, `han-github`, `han-reporting`, `han-feedback`, `han-atlassian`, or `han-linear`) and add a `SKILL.md`.
2. Write the `SKILL.md`:
   - Frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`. See [skill-description-frontmatter.md](./han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/skill-building-guidance/skill-description-frontmatter.md).
   - Body: numbered steps, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` paths for script references, extracted references under `references/`.
3. Copy [the skill template](./docs/templates/skill-long-form-template.md) into `docs/skills/{plugin}/{name}.md` and fill it in. Every skill gets a long-form doc.
4. Add the skill to the [Skills Index](./docs/skills/README.md) with a one-sentence scent line and a link.
5. Add the skill to the catalog in [Root CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). The indexes and concept docs list skills without a running total, so there is no count to bump. If the skill belongs to a new category, add it to the category lists too.
6. Update the marketplace registry at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) if the new skill ships in a different plugin's component set.

## Adding an agent

1. Create `han-core/agents/{name}.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`) and the agent body. See [agent-domain-focus.md](./han-plugin-builder/skills/guidance/references/agent-building-guidelines/agent-domain-focus.md) for how narrow and named the domain vocabulary should be.
2. Copy [the agent template](./docs/templates/agent-long-form-template.md) into `docs/agents/han-core/{name}.md` and fill it in. Every agent gets a long-form doc.
3. Add the agent to the [Agents Index](./docs/agents/README.md) under the right role group.

## Wiring the readability standard into a skill

If the skill you are adding is **reader-facing** (its primary deliverable is human-facing prose that a non-author reads end to end to understand something: a finding, a summary, a plan of record, a document), it applies the shared [Readability](./docs/readability.md) standard. Skills whose primary output is code, or a governed structured artifact (a specification, plan, work-item, or coding standard), are out of scope and skip this section.

The inclusion test is the guide; the enumerated list in [Readability](./docs/readability.md#scope-which-skills-are-reader-facing) is authoritative. When a new skill passes the test, add it to that list and wire the standard in:

1. **Vendor the rule.** The canonical rule is [`han-core/references/readability-rule.md`](./han-core/references/readability-rule.md). If the skill ships in a plugin that does not yet carry a copy, copy the file byte-for-byte into that plugin's `references/` directory (the same way [`yagni-rule.md`](./han-core/references/yagni-rule.md) and `evidence-rule.md` are vendored). Never wire a skill to load the rule before its plugin carries the copy. When the rule changes, update the canonical copy and re-copy it into every plugin that ships an in-scope skill.
2. **Embed the structural rules in the output template.** The skill's output template carries main-point-first, descriptive front-loaded headings, one-idea-per-paragraph, numbered lists for steps and bullets for the rest, and progressive disclosure, so the draft is born structured.
3. **Load and apply the rule, with an audience frame.** The skill reads `../../references/readability-rule.md` as it produces output and holds the audience frame: a capable reader who did not do the work. If the skill's real reader is a specific expert (an engineer, a pull-request reviewer, a non-technical stakeholder), name that reader instead of defaulting, and scope the frame per section so technical specifics the reader needs are not simplified away.
4. **Add the standardized self-check.** Before presenting, the skill runs the six behaviorally-anchored yes/no criteria (main point first, descriptive headings, one idea per paragraph, sentence length, no blocklisted word, every fact preserved) over the prose regions only, and corrects any failure. Leave code fences, diagram bodies, rendered markup, and citation identifiers unevaluated and unchanged.
5. **Wire the rewrite pass only if the skill synthesizes.** If the skill has a synthesis or editor step (a distinct pass, after the full draft exists, that reviews or consolidates the whole draft before presenting it), dispatch the [`readability-editor`](./docs/agents/han-core/readability-editor.md) agent to rewrite the draft against the rule, preserving every fact, after the draft is written and before the self-check. Where the skill already ran a readability pass of its own, the dedicated reviewer replaces it rather than stacking a second pass on top. A synthesis skill that cannot dispatch an agent today gains that capability as part of wiring the standard in.

Keep the applied set tight. The rule is applied in stages (template, then a discrete self-check, plus the rewrite pass for synthesis skills), never as one stacked instruction block.

## Editing an existing long-form doc

The docs follow a strict template. Before changing a section's shape, check [`docs/templates/skill-long-form-template.md`](./docs/templates/skill-long-form-template.md) or [`docs/templates/agent-long-form-template.md`](./docs/templates/agent-long-form-template.md) so the change stays consistent across peers.

If you are adding a section that is not in the template but applies to several skills or agents, raise it as a template change first. Drift across peer docs is worse than a missing section.

## Writing voice

All han documentation follows the writing voice profile in [`docs/writing-voice.md`](./docs/writing-voice.md). The most load-bearing rules:

- No em-dashes anywhere. Replace with periods, colons, commas, or parentheses.
- Direct second person (*"you"*), mentor-tone, plainspoken. No flattery, no hype words.
- Avoid *"leverage," "utilize," "showcase," "robust" (as a vague positive), "actually," "just," "It's worth noting," "Importantly,"* and similar AI-slop tells.
- Open with context or history, not a thesis statement.

The full voice profile names the prohibited words, the preferred sentence rhythms, and the structural moves the docs use.

## Documentation conventions

- **One canonical source per concept.** The long-form doc is canonical. The Skills Index and Agents Index carry scent only. One sentence plus a link. The README never duplicates long-form content.
- **Every long-form doc links up.** The Related Documentation section's first bullet points back to [the plugin landing page](./README.md). A reader arriving cold via search must be able to get to the front door in one click.
- **Orientation frame on top.** The first two lines of every long-form doc state what the page is, who it is for, and where the internal definition (`SKILL.md` or agent `.md`) lives.
- **TL;DR before anything else.** Three lines: what / when / what-you-get-back. Scannable for readers doing reference lookup.
- **YAGNI applies to docs too.** Doc sections that fail the [YAGNI](./docs/yagni.md) evidence test (speculative usage notes, *for-future-flexibility* warnings, examples for behavior the skill doesn't have yet) are not added. The same evidence rule that gates plan steps and code recommendations gates documentation.

## Reviewing your own changes

Before opening the PR, run through this checklist:

- [ ] Frontmatter is valid (no XML, no reserved prefixes, description under 1024 characters).
- [ ] `allowed-tools` matches actual usage; Bash permissions are per-prefix, not wildcards.
- [ ] Context injection commands (`` !`command` ``) are simple; complex operations live in scripts.
- [ ] Long-form doc follows the template.
- [ ] The skill or agent appears in the right index, at the right group, with accurate scent.
- [ ] Internal links resolve.
- [ ] No em-dashes anywhere in the doc.
- [ ] No *"actually," "just," "leverage," "utilize," "showcase," "robust" (vague), "It's worth noting," "Importantly,"* or other voice violations.
