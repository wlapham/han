# Local Development

Test skill changes locally before pushing to a PR by using your local repo clone as a marketplace source. Changes on your branch are immediately available in any Claude instance on your machine.

## Setup

### 1. Install the git hook

Run this once after cloning:

```bash
./install-hooks.sh
```

This installs a pre-push hook that automatically rebuilds `dist/claude-marketplace/` and `marketplace.json` before each push. If generated files changed, it commits them and asks you to push again so the generated commit is included.

### 2. Open Claude from the repo root

```bash
cd /path/to/skills-internal
claude
```

### 3. Remove the remote marketplace (if present)

If you previously installed `testdouble/skills-internal` from GitHub, remove it so it doesn't conflict with the local source:

1. Run `/plugin`
2. Switch to the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Select `testdouble/skills-internal` and remove it
4. Exit Claude and re-launch it (marketplace changes require a restart)

### 4. Add the local repo as a marketplace

1. Run `/plugin`
2. Switch to the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Select **Add marketplace**
4. Enter `./` as the path
5. Confirm the addition

### 5. Install the plugin you're working on

1. Run `/plugin`
2. Switch to the **Marketplace** tab (singular: this is the plugin browser, not the marketplace config tab)
3. Find and select the plugin you want to test
4. Install it in **user scope** so it's available across all your Claude instances, not just this project

## Workflow

Once installed, your local marketplace points at your working tree. Any changes you make to skill files (`SKILL.md`, references, scripts) are picked up immediately. No reinstall needed. This means you can:

1. Edit a skill on your branch
2. Open (or switch to) any Claude instance
3. Run the skill and see your changes

When you're done testing, remove the local marketplace and re-add the remote `testdouble/skills-internal` source to go back to the published versions.
