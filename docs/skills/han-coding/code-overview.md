# /code-overview

Operator documentation for the `/code-overview` skill in the han plugin. This document helps you decide *when* and *how* to use the skill. For what the skill does internally, read the skill definition at [`han-coding/skills/code-overview/SKILL.md`](../../../han-coding/skills/code-overview/SKILL.md).

## TL;DR

- **What it does.** Produces a human-readable, progressive-disclosure overview of unfamiliar code (as it is now) or of a pull request's changes (what they do and why), so you can get up to speed before working on or reviewing it.
- **When to use it.** You have landed in code you do not know, or a PR you are about to review, and you want a fast orientation before you start.
- **What you get back.** A scratch overview file (written outside the repository) with a purpose statement, Mermaid flow charts, the directly-related context, and where to start — at minimal technical depth.
- **Size-aware.** The skill classifies the target as small / medium / large, defaults to small, and scales how many `codebase-explorer` agents it dispatches. Pass the size as the first positional argument to override (`/code-overview medium`). See [Sizing](../../sizing.md).

## Key concepts

- **Two modes.** *Code mode* explains a file, directory, or symbol as it is now. *PR mode* explains a set of changes — what they do, grouped by intent, and how to look at the PR before reviewing it. The skill picks the mode from the target.
- **Understand now, not document for later.** The overview is an ephemeral orientation aid written to a scratch file, never committed into the repository's documentation tree. That is the line against `/project-documentation`.
- **No findings.** The overview raises no quality findings, severities, or recommended changes — even the PR-mode "what to watch" section is navigational, naming where the change is hardest to follow, not whether it is any good. That is the line against `/code-review`.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The most important understanding comes first (what it is and why), then the flow chart, then context, then where to start. A reader who stops early still knows what the target is.
- **Minimal technical detail, scoped per section.** Purpose, flow, and context stay high-level; the where-to-start section is the exception and names concrete entry points so you can actually open the right file.

## When to use it

**Invoke when:**

- You have been handed code you have never seen and need to work on it.
- You are about to review a PR and want to understand what it does and why before you start reading line by line.
- You are ramping onto an unfamiliar module, directory, or symbol and want a map before you dive in.

**Do not invoke for:**

- **Reviewing code quality or finding problems.** Use [`/code-review`](./code-review.md) instead (or [`/post-code-review-to-pr`](../han-github/post-code-review-to-pr.md) to post a review to GitHub).
- **Writing durable feature or system documentation.** Use [`/project-documentation`](../han-core/project-documentation.md) instead.
- **Assessing architecture, coupling, or structural risk.** Use [`/architectural-analysis`](./architectural-analysis.md) instead.
- **Diagnosing a bug or root-causing a failure.** Use [`/investigate`](./investigate.md) instead.

## How to invoke it

Run `/code-overview` in Claude Code.

Give it:

1. **A target (optional).** A file path, a directory, a symbol name, or a pull request reference / URL. With no target, the skill defaults to the current branch's changes in PR mode. A sharp target is a single file, symbol, directory, or PR; a thin one ("explain the backend") forces the skill to ask you to narrow it.
2. **A size (optional).** `small`, `medium`, or `large` as the first positional argument, when you want to override the skill's auto-classification.

Example prompts:

- `/code-overview`. *"Explain what the changes on this branch do before I review them."*
- `/code-overview src/auth/`. *"Help me understand the auth module before I work on it."*
- `/code-overview #82`. *"Walk me through pull request 82 so I know how to review it."*
- `/code-overview large src/billing/`. *"Give me a thorough overview of the billing subsystem."*

## What you get back

A single Markdown overview file written to a scratch location **outside the repository** (for example under your system temp directory). The skill shows you the path; open it where the Mermaid charts render. The file is not committed and is not maintained — it is a point-in-time orientation aid.

The document follows one structure per mode, under a shared grammar:

- **Code mode:** a header (target, mode, generation context) → *What it does and why* → *Main flow* (a Mermaid chart with a scope label) → *Context and uses* → *Where to start*.
- **PR mode:** the same header → *What this change does and why* → *Changes by intent* (grouped by the outcome each group delivers) → *How the change flows* (a Mermaid chart with a scope label) → *What to watch when reviewing* (navigational only).

When the target is too large to cover fully at the chosen size, the overview adds a coverage note immediately after the header, naming what it did not cover and the next size up, so you know the picture is partial before you study the charts.

## How to get the most out of it

- **Name a sharp target.** A file, a symbol, a directory, or a specific PR gets a focused overview. "The whole app" does not — the skill will ask you to narrow it.
- **Let the default carry the PR case.** With no argument on a feature branch, the skill orients you to exactly the changes you are about to review. You rarely need to name the PR explicitly.
- **Re-run larger when coverage is partial.** If the overview adds a coverage note, re-run at the next size up for a fuller picture rather than guessing at the gaps.
- **Read it before `/code-review`, not instead of it.** The overview tells you how to look at a PR; the review tells you whether the PR is any good. Run code-overview first to orient, then `/code-review` to judge.

## Sizing

The skill is one of the size-aware skills. It classifies the target and scales the exploration roster:

| Size | Typical target | Explorers dispatched |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** *(default)* | A single file, a single symbol, or a small change set | 1 |
| **Medium** | A directory or module, or a moderate change set across one or two subsystems | 2–3 |
| **Large** | Multiple subsystems, or a large change set | 3–5 |

Classification defaults to small and escalates only on a clear signal; a borderline target stays at the smaller band. Pass `small`, `medium`, or `large` as the first positional argument to override. The roster is intentionally lean — `codebase-explorer` agents only — because this is read-only orientation, not the multi-specialist audit that `/code-review` and `/architectural-analysis` run. See [Sizing](../../sizing.md) for the cross-skill model.

## Cost and latency

The skill runs on the default model tier and dispatches a lean roster: one to five `han-core:codebase-explorer` agents in parallel, scaled to size, followed by a single synthesis pass the skill performs itself. The most expensive single step is the parallel exploration wave at large size. It is built for quick, on-demand orientation, so it is cheap at small size and safe to run often; it is read-only and re-runnable, so there is no approval gate before it works.

## In more detail

The skill orchestrates and synthesizes; the agents only discover. It resolves the target by a fixed precedence — an explicit pull request reference first, then a file or directory path, then a symbol, and finally (with no target) the current branch's changes — so an ambiguous string never silently selects the wrong mode. It classifies size, dispatches `codebase-explorer` agents over the target or the changed files, and then writes the overview itself: the grouping, the charts, and the orientation are the skill's work, not pasted agent output.

PR mode runs on the local branch diff and does not require a remote pull request; a remote PR is needed only when you name one explicitly. The skill degrades gracefully when its tools are missing: code mode against a named target still runs without git, while PR mode and the bare-invocation default tell you they need git to read changes. When a named pull request cannot be reached, the skill offers code mode against a local target instead.

## Sources

The skill's posture is grounded in established practice for progressive disclosure, information scent, and program comprehension. Each source below is cited because the skill draws a specific, named artifact from it.

### Jakob Nielsen: Progressive Disclosure

Nielsen's work on progressive disclosure (Nielsen Norman Group) is the structural principle behind the overview's section order: show the single most important thing first, then let detail unfold beneath it, so a reader who stops early is still oriented correctly. The skill's "what it does and why → flow → context → where to start" ordering is this principle applied to code.

### Peter Pirolli and Stuart Card: Information Foraging Theory

Pirolli and Card's information-foraging work formalized "information scent" — the cues a reader follows to decide where to look next. The skill's content-bearing section headings, the chart scope labels, and the partial-coverage note exist so a reader can forage the overview efficiently and know when the picture is incomplete.

### Spinellis and others: Program Comprehension

The program-comprehension literature establishes that developers understand unfamiliar code by building a mental model from entry points, control flow, and call relationships before reading detail. The skill's flow charts and its "where to start" section target exactly that model-building path, at minimal technical depth.
