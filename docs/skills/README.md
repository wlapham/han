# Skills

All skills in the Han suite, grouped by the plugin that ships them. `han.core` carries enough skills to group by purpose, so it has sub-categories; the other plugins are flat lists. Each entry is a one-sentence scent line plus a link to the canonical long-form doc.

> See also: [Plugin landing page](../../README.md) · [Concepts](../concepts.md) · [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) · [All agents](../agents/README.md) · [Sizing](../sizing.md) · [YAGNI](../yagni.md)

## New here?

Start on the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md). It picks the right skill for what you are trying to do right now. If the skill / agent split is fuzzy, read [Concepts](../concepts.md) first.

## han.core

The base plugin. It carries the research, analysis, documentation, and operations skills, plus every agent those skills dispatch. Grouped by purpose below.

### Triage & research

Skills for triaging an incoming report and researching your options, with evidence to back it.

- **[`/issue-triage`](./han.core/issue-triage.md).** Classify a vague issue or bug report, identify missing information, assess severity and reproducibility, and recommend the right next skill to run.
- **[`/research`](./han.core/research.md).** Research an open-ended question — options, possible solutions, prior art, or how something works — across the codebase and the open web, ending at an adversarially-validated recommendation without committing the team to any artifact. The question-shaped sibling of `/investigate`; scales with [size](../sizing.md).

### Analysis

Skills for comparing two artifacts against each other.

- **[`/gap-analysis`](./han.core/gap-analysis.md).** Compare two artifacts (current state vs. desired state, for example spec vs. implementation, or PRD vs. shipped feature) and produce a plain-language, stakeholder-readable report indexed by stable gap IDs. Dispatches `gap-analyzer` for the primary analysis, then runs a validator-and-augmenter swarm by default — `adversarial-validator` and `junior-developer` (actor-perspective sweep) always, plus `evidence-based-investigator` when the current state is concrete, plus domain specialists and `project-manager` at medium and large. Opt out with `no swarm` for the lightweight pass.

### Discovery & context

Skills that produce context every other skill benefits from.

- **[`/project-discovery`](./han.core/project-discovery.md).** Scan the repository for languages, frameworks, tooling, and structure. Writes a static reference for other skills.
- **[`/project-documentation`](./han.core/project-documentation.md).** Create and maintain documentation for features, systems, and components.

### Conventions & decisions

Skills for recording how the team works.

- **[`/architectural-decision-record`](./han.core/architectural-decision-record.md).** Create, extract, or convert architectural decision records.

### Operations

Skills for capturing operational knowledge in artifacts the next on-call engineer can use.

- **[`/runbook`](./han.core/runbook.md).** Create or update a runbook for a single operational scenario (alert that has fired, incident, recurring task, known failure mode). Symptom-first template with imperative-voice procedure, expected output per step, escalation conditions, and rollback. Applies a YAGNI preflight that requires real evidence before writing.

## han.planning

The planning layer: the skills for specifying *what* a feature does, planning *how* to build it, sequencing the build, breaking it into work, and stress-testing plans before you commit. Depends on `han.core`; bundled by the `han` meta-plugin.

- **[`/plan-a-feature`](./han.planning/plan-a-feature.md).** Build a feature specification from scratch through an evidence-based interview that walks the design tree and dispatches specialist reviewers.
- **[`/plan-implementation`](./han.planning/plan-implementation.md).** Turn a feature specification into an implementation plan through a project-manager-led team conversation.
- **[`/plan-a-phased-build`](./han.planning/plan-a-phased-build.md).** Split a body of context (gap analysis, PRD, design doc, feature spec, requirements list) into a numbered sequence of vertical-slice build phases, each independently demoable to a real person and each building on the prior. Dispatches `information-architect` against the rendered outline to verify findability, EPPO standalone-ness of phase entries, and progressive comprehension.
- **[`/iterative-plan-review`](./han.planning/iterative-plan-review.md).** Stress-test an already-written plan through multiple codebase-grounded review passes.
- **[`/plan-work-items`](./han.planning/plan-work-items.md).** Divide a trusted implementation plan into independently-grabbable work items in a single work-items file.

## han.coding

The coding layer: the skills you reach for while working in code. Writing it, reviewing it, analyzing it, testing it, investigating it, and standardizing it. Depends on `han.core`; bundled by the `han` meta-plugin.

- **[`/tdd`](./han.coding/tdd.md).** Drive a feature or behavior through a BDD-framed red-green-refactor loop. Builds a behavior test list, enforces an observed-failure gate (no production code until a test has been run and seen to fail), works outside-in for user-facing behavior, and applies the project's coding standards and ADRs in green (correctness) and refactor (full conformance plus YAGNI). It writes code, not a document.
- **[`/refactor`](./han.coding/refactor.md).** Restructure existing code without changing its behavior. Takes a named target (files, a module, a named smell, or the findings of a prior `/code-review` or `/architectural-analysis`), refuses to start without a green suite covering that target, plans a sequence of small named refactorings, re-runs the full suite after every step, and stops hard when changes spread beyond the declared scope. It writes code, not a document; cleanup inside an active TDD cycle belongs to `/tdd`'s refactor step instead.
- **[`/code-review`](./han.coding/code-review.md).** Run a comprehensive code review on the current branch or specified files. Always dispatches `junior-developer` and `adversarial-security-analyst`, and conditionally adds `test-engineer`, `edge-case-explorer`, `structural-analyst`, `behavioral-analyst`, `concurrency-analyst`, `data-engineer`, or `devops-engineer` when the changed files trigger their domain. Roster scales with [size](../sizing.md).
- **[`/architectural-analysis`](./han.coding/architectural-analysis.md).** Deep architectural analysis of a module: coupling, data flow, concurrency, risk, and SOLID alignment. Always dispatches the `structural-analyst` / `behavioral-analyst` / `risk-analyst` / `software-architect` spine, and adds `concurrency-analyst`, `adversarial-security-analyst`, `data-engineer`, `devops-engineer`, `codebase-explorer`, or `system-architect` by signal. Roster scales with [size](../sizing.md).
- **[`/test-planning`](./han.coding/test-planning.md).** Produce a prioritized test plan for a branch or directory. Dispatches `test-engineer` and `edge-case-explorer`, plus `concurrency-analyst` or `adversarial-security-analyst` when the files call for it.
- **[`/investigate`](./han.coding/investigate.md).** Evidence-based investigation of bugs, failures, and unexpected behavior, with adversarial validation of the proposed fix.
- **[`/coding-standard`](./han.coding/coding-standard.md).** Create and update coding standards from existing patterns or evidence-based research.

## han.github

GitHub-facing skills that talk to GitHub through the `gh` CLI. Depends on `han.core`.

- **[`/post-code-review-to-pr`](./han.github/post-code-review-to-pr.md).** Run `/code-review` against a GitHub PR and post the review as comments, after a `junior-developer` clarity check on the drafted review body.
- **[`/update-pr-description`](./han.github/update-pr-description.md).** Generate a PR description from the current branch's changes, conforming to the repository's PR template when one exists.
- **[`/work-items-to-issues`](./han.github/work-items-to-issues.md).** Publish each item in a `/plan-work-items` work-items file as a GitHub issue in its target repo, with within-repo blockers linked, screenshots copied into the repo, and no label or assignee by default.

## han.reporting

Skills for turning the work back into something sharable with non-technical stakeholders. Depends on `han.core`.

- **[`/stakeholder-summary`](./han.reporting/stakeholder-summary.md).** Turn a feature specification into a plain-language stakeholder summary with Mermaid diagrams for user experience and data flow — for getting non-technical feedback before implementation kicks off.
- **[`/html-summary`](./han.reporting/html-summary.md).** Convert a `stakeholder-summary.md` (from [`/stakeholder-summary`](./han.reporting/stakeholder-summary.md)) into a single self-contained HTML executive report — bottom line and asks up front, mermaid diagrams inlined, styled with a Test Double-derived palette. Produces the HTML file only; does not publish it.

## han.feedback

The opt-in feedback plugin. It captures observations about the Han suite itself. The `han` meta-plugin does not bundle it; install it on its own with `/plugin install han.feedback@han`. Depends on `han.core`.

- **[`/han-feedback`](./han.feedback/han-feedback.md).** Capture structured post-session feedback on the Han skills and agents you used across the whole `han.*` plugin family, and optionally post it as a GitHub issue to testdouble/han.

## han.atlassian

The opt-in Atlassian plugin. It publishes Han artifacts to Confluence and Jira through the Atlassian MCP server. The `han` meta-plugin does not bundle it; install it on its own with `/plugin install han.atlassian@han`. Requires a configured Atlassian MCP server. Depends on `han.core`.

- **[`/markdown-to-confluence`](./han.atlassian/markdown-to-confluence.md).** Publish one local Markdown file to a user-specified Confluence location, creating a new page or updating an existing one. Defaults to an unpublished draft. Requires the user to name the destination (a page URL, or a space plus parent page); it does not search Confluence for the right place. Posts an existing file; it does not generate documentation.
- **[`/project-documentation-to-confluence`](./han.atlassian/project-documentation-to-confluence.md).** Run `/project-documentation` to write feature documentation to a temporary file, show it for review, then publish it to a user-specified Confluence location with `/markdown-to-confluence` after confirmation. Requires the user to name the destination (a page URL, or a space plus parent page); it does not search Confluence for the right place.
- **[`/plan-a-feature-to-confluence`](./han.atlassian/plan-a-feature-to-confluence.md).** Run `/plan-a-feature` to build a feature specification in a temporary folder, show it for review, then publish it to a user-specified Confluence location with `/markdown-to-confluence` after confirmation: the spec as a parent page and each companion artifact (decision log, team findings, technical notes) as a child page beneath it. Requires the user to name the destination (a page URL, or a space plus parent page); it does not search Confluence for the right place.
- **[`/work-items-to-jira`](./han.atlassian/work-items-to-jira.md).** Create one Jira ticket per slice from a `/plan-work-items` work-items file, in a single target project. Defaults to a Story, unassigned, in the backlog, with the reporter taken from the Atlassian MCP identity; epic parenting, issue type, assignee, and target column are optional overrides. The Jira sibling of `/work-items-to-issues`.

## han.linear

The opt-in Linear plugin. It publishes Han work items to Linear through the Linear MCP server. The `han` meta-plugin does not bundle it; install it on its own with `/plugin install han.linear@han`. Requires a configured Linear MCP server. Depends on `han.core`.

- **[`/work-items-to-linear`](./han.linear/work-items-to-linear.md).** Create one Linear issue per slice from a `/plan-work-items` work-items file, in a single target team. Reads the team's real workflow states, labels, Projects, and members and resolves every option against them before creating anything; defaults each issue to the team's initial state, unassigned, and uncategorized, with optional state, labels, assignee, parent (sub-issue), and Project. Links within-file `Depends on` lines as native Linear "blocked by" relations. The Linear sibling of `/work-items-to-jira` and `/work-items-to-issues`.

## han.plugin-builder

The opt-in plugin-building plugin. It carries the authoring guidance for skills, agents, and plugins, plus two interview-driven builders that author a new component from scratch and review it against that guidance. It depends on nothing, and the `han` meta-plugin does not bundle it; install it on its own with `/plugin install han.plugin-builder@han`.

- **[`/guidance`](./han.plugin-builder/guidance.md).** Serve the authoritative guidance for building skills, agents, and plugins, or vendor all three plugin-building skills into the current repository's `.claude/skills/` under a `plugin-` prefix (`plugin-guidance`, `plugin-skill-builder`, `plugin-agent-builder`) plus a path-scoped rule index (`/guidance init`) so the skills run and the guidance surfaces with no dependency on the plugin (`/guidance update` refreshes a vendored copy).
- **[`/skill-builder`](./han.plugin-builder/skill-builder.md).** Build a new skill from scratch through an evidence-based interview that walks the skill's design tree decision-by-decision, then review the finished files against the plugin-building guidance and apply every fix.
- **[`/agent-builder`](./han.plugin-builder/agent-builder.md).** Build a new agent from scratch through an evidence-based interview that walks the agent's design tree decision-by-decision, then review the finished self-contained agent file against the plugin-building guidance and apply every fix.

## How dispatch scales: sizing

The sizing-aware skills ([`/architectural-analysis`](./han.coding/architectural-analysis.md), [`/code-review`](./han.coding/code-review.md), [`/gap-analysis`](./han.core/gap-analysis.md), [`/iterative-plan-review`](./han.planning/iterative-plan-review.md), [`/plan-a-feature`](./han.planning/plan-a-feature.md), [`/plan-implementation`](./han.planning/plan-implementation.md), [`/research`](./han.core/research.md)) classify the work as **small**, **medium**, or **large** before dispatching agents, and scale the team or swarm size to the chosen band. The default is always small. Pass `small`, `medium`, or `large` as the first positional argument to override.

See [Sizing](../sizing.md) for the cross-skill model and per-skill bands. Each sizing-aware skill's long-form doc has its own **Sizing** section with the skill-specific signals and caps.

## What survives a review: YAGNI

Every planning, review, and standards skill in the plugin applies an evidence-based YAGNI rule before committing items to its artifact. Items without acceptable evidence move to a `## Deferred (YAGNI)` section with a named *reopen-when* trigger. Never silently dropped. The rule applies to:

- **Planning.** [`/plan-a-feature`](./han.planning/plan-a-feature.md), [`/plan-implementation`](./han.planning/plan-implementation.md), [`/plan-a-phased-build`](./han.planning/plan-a-phased-build.md), [`/iterative-plan-review`](./han.planning/iterative-plan-review.md).
- **Review and standards.** [`/code-review`](./han.coding/code-review.md) (advisory-only), [`/coding-standard`](./han.coding/coding-standard.md), [`/test-planning`](./han.coding/test-planning.md), [`/architectural-decision-record`](./han.core/architectural-decision-record.md) (forcing-function requirement).
- **Building.** [`/tdd`](./han.coding/tdd.md) (enforcing in the refactor step and the test list), [`/refactor`](./han.coding/refactor.md) (enforcing on the refactoring plan: every item needs evidence the code has a reason to change).

See [YAGNI](../yagni.md) for the two gates, the acceptable-evidence list, the named anti-patterns, and the deferral format.

## How skills compose

Most han skills dispatch agents to do their judgment-heavy work. The [Concepts](../concepts.md) page explains the split. The long-form doc for each skill names the specific agents it dispatches.

A few common compositions:

- **Triage → investigate.** `/issue-triage` → `/investigate`.
- **Triage → research → spec.** `/issue-triage` → `/research` → `/plan-a-feature` (when triage finds a problem-space unknown, research the options first, then specify the chosen one).
- **Create specs → plan implementation → iterate → break into work items.** `/plan-a-feature` → `/plan-implementation` → `/iterative-plan-review` → `/plan-work-items`.
- **Plan implementation → break into work items.** `/plan-implementation` → `/plan-work-items`.
- **Break into work items → publish to GitHub issues.** `/plan-work-items` → `/work-items-to-issues`.
- **Break into work items → publish to Jira.** `/plan-work-items` → `/work-items-to-jira` (opt-in `han.atlassian` plugin; requires the Atlassian MCP server).
- **Discover → document → standardize.** `/project-discovery` → `/project-documentation` → `/coding-standard`.
- **Review locally → post to PR.** `/code-review` → `/post-code-review-to-pr`.
- **Review → execute the refactorings.** `/code-review` or `/architectural-analysis` → `/refactor` (the review's structural findings become the refactoring plan's work orders).
- **Prepare the ground → build.** `/refactor` → `/tdd` (preparatory refactoring makes the change easy, then `/tdd` makes the easy change).
- **Investigate → iterate on the fix.** `/investigate` → `/iterative-plan-review`.
- **Compare → plan the remediation.** `/gap-analysis` → `/plan-implementation` (the gap report's `G-NNN` IDs become work items in the implementation plan).
- **Compare → phase the build → plan implementation per phase.** `/gap-analysis` → `/plan-a-phased-build` → `/plan-implementation` (the gap report orders `G-NNN` IDs into vertical slices, then each phase gets its own implementation plan once greenlit).
