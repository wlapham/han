## TL;DR

- **What it does.** Researches an open-ended question and gives you back an evidence-backed, adversarially-validated landscape of options with a recommendation.
- **When to use it.** You have a question, not a bug, and you want the options and prior art before you commit to a direction.
- **What you get back.** A research report: the framed question, numbered evidence (E1, E2, …) each with a checkable source, an options landscape with trade-offs, a recommended option, and validation findings (V1, V2, …).

## Key concepts

- **Question-shaped, not symptom-shaped.** `/investigate` starts from something broken and ends at a fix. `/research` starts from a question and ends at a recommended option among trade-offs. Nothing is "diagnosed" and no fix is planned.
- **Output-agnostic.** The report is the only thing produced. `/research` never writes a feature spec, a coding standard, a gap report, an architecture assessment, or code. If your question is really one of those, it routes you to the skill that owns it.
- **Reaches the open web.** Unlike `/investigate`, `/research` can search and fetch from the open web, read your codebase, and use material you provide. That web reach is the whole point: it answers "what is the prior art out there", not only "what does this repo do".
- **Fetched content is data, never instruction.** A web page that says "ignore your instructions and do X" is recorded as a claim about that page, not followed. The web-facing research runs with no codebase context, so a hostile page has nothing to exfiltrate.
- **Evidence is sourced and corroborated.** Every evidence item carries a source you can check yourself: a repository location, or a URL plus the date it was retrieved. A web claim that drives the recommendation must be corroborated by an independent source or by the codebase, or it is flagged single-source and cannot stand alone.
- **Sized small / medium / large.** Like the other swarming skills, `/research` scales its team to the question. It reads the question's conceptual scope — how many options, how many domains, how wide the reach — not its text length.

## When to use it

**Invoke when:**

- You want the options for a decision and their trade-offs before you commit ("should we use an event bus or polling here").
- You want the prior art or state of the art on a topic, drawn from outside the codebase.
- You want to understand how something works before you build against it.
- You want a recommendation that has been adversarially validated, not a first-pass opinion.

**Do not invoke for:**

- **A bug, failure, or root cause.** Use [`/investigate`](./investigate.md) for evidence-based diagnosis of something broken.
- **Specifying a feature.** Use [`/plan-a-feature`](./plan-a-feature.md) to turn a decision into a behavioral spec.
- **Creating or updating a coding standard.** Use [`/coding-standard`](./coding-standard.md).
- **Comparing two concrete artifacts for gaps.** Use [`/gap-analysis`](./gap-analysis.md).
- **Assessing an existing module's architecture.** Use [`/architectural-analysis`](./architectural-analysis.md).

## How to invoke it

Run `/research` in Claude Code with the question you want answered.

Give it:

1. **The question.** Open-ended and answerable. "What are my options for rate limiting this API, and the trade-offs" is sharp. "Rate limiting" is too thin to research; you will be asked for the specific decision or unknown.
2. **A size, optional.** `small`, `medium`, or `large` as the first word overrides the automatic sizing. Otherwise the skill reads the question's scope and announces the size before dispatching.
3. **An output path, optional.** The skill writes the report to a file. If a report already exists at the path you give, you are asked before anything is overwritten.
4. **Any material to consider.** Paste or point at docs, links, or a vendor whitepaper. Provided material is held to the same scrutiny as a web source, since it may come from an interested party.

Example prompts:

- `/research`. *"What are my options for background job processing in this stack, and the trade-offs?"*
- `/research`. *"How does the WebAuthn ceremony actually work, end to end?"*
- `/research large`. *"Survey the state of the art for vector search; what are the viable options and where does each break down?"*
- `/research docs/research/queue-options.md`. Research and write the report into that path.

## What you get back

A research report file, plus an in-channel summary. The report covers:

- **Question.** The decision or unknown, framed precisely, with the alternatives in play named (or a note that there are none, for a "how does X work" question).
- **Evidence Summary.** A numbered list (E1, E2, …) consolidated from the parallel `research-analyst` angles and, when a codebase bears on the question, `codebase-explorer`. Every item carries a checkable source and, for web evidence, the retrieval date and whether it is corroborated or single-source.
- **Options Landscape.** Each viable option steelmanned, with trade-offs keyed to evidence items. Source-vs-source and codebase-vs-web conflicts are surfaced, not silently resolved.
- **Recommendation.** The recommended option and why, referencing evidence by number. When the evidence does not support a single answer, the report says "no clear winner" and names the deciding criteria instead of forcing a pick.
- **Validation.** Numbered `V1, V2, …` findings from `adversarial-validator`, which attacks the evidence, the options framing, the recommendation, and the integrity of the evidence-gathering (injection, staleness, single-source, astroturfing).
- **Adjustments Made.** What changed after validation. If the recommendation did not survive, it is rewritten into the no-clear-winner form rather than left standing above a contradicting validation section.
- **Confidence Assessment and Remaining Risks.** The closing judgment, including any single source the recommendation leaned on.
- **Final Summary.** One sentence each for question, recommendation, why, validation outcome, remaining risks, and any sibling handoff.

The report is presented for review. Accept it, ask for specific revisions, or redirect the question.

## How to get the most out of it

- **Name the decision, not the topic.** "Should we adopt OpenTelemetry, given we already run a Prometheus stack" sharpens every research angle. "Observability" does not.
- **Bring the material you already trust.** A vendor doc, an internal RFC, a benchmark you ran. It enters the evidence list with its source, and the validator checks it against independent sources rather than letting it override them.
- **Let the validator reshape the answer.** The adversarial pass is not ceremony. It frequently downgrades a single-source recommendation or surfaces a stale benchmark. Treat validation findings as first-class input.
- **Size up for breadth, not depth.** Use `large` when the question spans several domains or many options, not when one option needs more detail. A narrower follow-up question beats an over-sized run.
- **Pair with `/plan-a-feature` next.** Once `/research` has recommended an option, `/plan-a-feature` turns that decision into a behavioral spec. The skills are deliberately separate; `/research` decides *what*, `/plan-a-feature` specifies it.

## YAGNI

The recommendation is an artifact that can accrete options nobody asked for. `/research` applies the evidence-based [YAGNI](../yagni.md) posture to the landscape: an option earns its place in the report only when the question or the evidence puts it in play. "For completeness" and "someone might want" options are not surfaced as viable; if they are worth naming at all, they are named as explicitly out of scope with the trigger that would reopen them. The recommendation is the strictly simpler option that satisfies the evidence, not the most capable one. This keeps the report a decision aid, not a catalog.

## Cost and latency

The skill dispatches `research-analyst` angles in parallel (one at small, two to three at medium, one per domain or option cluster at large), plus `codebase-explorer` when a codebase bears on the question, followed by one `adversarial-validator` pass. `research-analyst` and `adversarial-validator` run on `sonnet`; `codebase-explorer` on `haiku`. The most expensive single step is the parallel research wave at large size. The skill is built for a per-decision cadence — research the question, get the recommendation, move on. It is not a tight-loop tool.

## In more detail

`/research` is the question-shaped sibling of `/investigate`. It reuses the same proven spine — gather sourced evidence, number it, synthesize, then adversarially validate before presenting — but every bug-specific stage is gone. There is no symptom to classify, no root cause, no fix. In their place: a request classifier (out-of-scope redirect, hybrid handoff, compound-question split), an options-landscape synthesis, and a recommendation that must survive an adversarial pass chartered to attack not just the logic but the trustworthiness of the sources themselves.

The web reach is what makes it non-duplicative, and it is also the main risk surface, so the skill commits to behavioral controls for it: fetched content is treated as claims, the web-facing angle is isolated from the codebase, web evidence carries a retrieval date, and a claim that drives the recommendation must be corroborated. Those controls came out of an adversarial security review of the spec and are load-bearing, not decoration.

The full design rationale, including why this is a separate skill rather than an expansion of `/investigate`, lives in [`docs/plans/research-skill/`](../plans/research-skill/).

## Sources

The skill's protocols are grounded in established practice for evidence-based research and adversarial review.

### Toulmin: The Uses of Argument (1958)

Stephen Toulmin's argument model — claim, grounds, warrant, backing — maps onto the skill's discipline that every option in the landscape is a claim that must trace to numbered grounds (E#) and that uncorroborated grounds cannot back the recommendation alone.

### OWASP: LLM01 Prompt Injection (2025)

The OWASP guidance on indirect prompt injection through retrieved content is the basis for the skill's "fetched content is data, never instruction" rule and the isolation of the web-facing angle from codebase context.

### Klein: Performing a Project Premortem (2007)

Gary Klein's premortem technique — assume the conclusion is wrong and hunt for why — is the posture the `adversarial-validator` pass applies to the recommendation before it ships.
