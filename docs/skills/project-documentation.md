# /project-documentation

Operator documentation for the `/project-documentation` skill in the han plugin. This document helps you decide *when* and *how* to use the skill. For what the skill does internally, read the skill definition at [`plugin/skills/project-documentation/SKILL.md`](../../plugin/skills/project-documentation/SKILL.md).

## TL;DR

- **What it does.** Creates and maintains project documentation for features, systems, and components; discovers project structure dynamically to work across stacks.
- **When to use it.** You want a feature, system, or component documented, or you want to update an existing doc to match what the code does now.
- **What you get back.** A new or updated `docs/{feature-name}.md` following the project's template conventions, with real code examples, cross-references, and a reference added to `CLAUDE.md`.

## Key concepts

- **Guard check.** If the topic is really an architectural decision, the skill suggests [`/architectural-decision-record`](./architectural-decision-record.md) instead. If it is a convention, it suggests [`/coding-standard`](./coding-standard.md). Only real feature or system documentation proceeds.
- **Codebase exploration in parallel.** Two or three `codebase-explorer` agents run in parallel (entry points and core logic, data models and config, tests and existing docs) and merge into a unified numbered discovery summary (D1, D2, D3…).
- **Real code, real paths.** Examples come from actual source files. Paths are absolute from the repo root.
- **Content audit when updating.** When updating a doc or migrating content from elsewhere, the skill dispatches `content-auditor` to classify every fact as Present / Correctly Removed / Missing, then restores missing facts.
- **Information-architecture review before verification.** An `information-architect` agent audits the written doc for findability, scannability, and whether the section order matches the likely reading path. Applied edits tighten the doc before it ships.
- **Bidirectional cross-references.** If the new doc references another doc, the other doc gets a reference back where it adds value.

## When to use it

**Invoke when:**

- A feature or subsystem exists in the codebase but is not yet documented.
- A doc has gone stale after a refactor, rename, or behavioral change. The skill re-explores the code and updates accordingly.
- Content needs to migrate out of CLAUDE.md or out of a pile of ad-hoc files into a proper feature doc. The content-audit step ensures nothing gets lost.
- A new feature has landed and you want its doc written before memory fades.

**Do not invoke for:**

- **Technology stack discovery.** Use [`/project-discovery`](./project-discovery.md) to detect languages, frameworks, and tooling.
- **Architectural decisions.** Use [`/architectural-decision-record`](./architectural-decision-record.md).
- **Coding conventions.** Use [`/coding-standard`](./coding-standard.md).
- **PR descriptions.** Use [`/update-pr-description`](./update-pr-description.md).

## How to invoke it

Run `/project-documentation` with a feature name or document path.

Give it:

1. **The feature or system to document.** *"The authentication system," "event-driven notification flow," "the webhook retry mechanism."*
2. **A file path, optional.** If updating, point at the existing doc. If creating, the skill derives the filename from the feature name in kebab-case.
3. **Known entry points, optional.** If you already know where the feature lives in the code, mention it. The skill's explorer agents find it anyway, but starting hints speed the pass.

Example prompts:

- `/project-documentation`. *"Document the authentication system."*
- `/project-documentation`. *"Update the payments documentation to reflect the new Stripe integration."*
- `/project-documentation`. *"Create documentation for the event-driven notification system. Entry point is `src/notifications/dispatcher.ts`."*
- `/project-documentation docs/webhooks.md`. *"Update this doc. The retry logic changed."*

## What you get back

A feature doc under the project's documentation root plus integration:

- **`docs/{feature-name}.md`.** The feature doc, following the template at [`references/template.md`](../../plugin/skills/project-documentation/references/template.md). Structural sections: title + one-sentence description, Overview, Key Files, Behavior, Configuration, Error Handling, Testing, and Related Documentation. Template sections marked CONDITIONAL are omitted when they do not apply.
- **Absolute file paths** from the repo root in every code example.
- **Concrete, annotated code examples** (10–30 lines) drawn from real files.
- **Language-specific code fences** matching the project's actual language.
- **`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` reference.** A line added in the section most relevant to the feature.
- **Bidirectional cross-references** to related docs.
- **Content audit summary** (when updating). Facts checked, facts present, facts correctly removed, facts missing (and restored).

## How to get the most out of it

- **Run `/project-discovery` first.** The skill uses the discovery reference to find the docs directory and to align code-fence languages with the project's stack.
- **Name entry points if you know them.** The explorer agents find them anyway, but seed paths make the exploration faster.
- **Let the content audit run.** When updating a doc, the audit catches facts the new version silently dropped. Facts that should have been removed need a codebase justification; the agent flags ones that look like accidental drops.
- **Skim the merged discovery summary.** The skill produces a unified D1/D2/D3 list from parallel explorers. If the list misses a file you know is relevant, say so. That is faster than letting the doc miss it.
- **Pair with `/architectural-decision-record`** if the documentation surfaces a decision that was never recorded.
- **Pair with `/coding-standard`** if the documentation surfaces a pattern that should become a rule.

## Cost and latency

The skill dispatches two to three `codebase-explorer` agents in parallel (Step 2), one `content-auditor` agent in update mode (Step 6), and one `information-architect` agent before verification (Step 7). All run on their default models. For a medium-size feature, expect a few minutes total. The skill is built for per-feature cadence. Avoid tight-loop iteration on the same doc without changes.

## In more detail

The skill walks an eight-step process:

1. **Evaluate and gather context.** Guard check for ADR/coding-standard topics, resolve the docs directory, derive the target filename, resolve author info, flag whether the content audit will run.
2. **Explore the codebase.** Two to three `codebase-explorer` agents in parallel; merge into a unified D1/D2/D3 discovery summary.
3. **Write the documentation.** Follow the template; absolute paths; concrete code examples; language-specific fences; conditional sections omitted; update mode preserves existing structure and flags provisional removals.
4. **Update agent configuration files.** Add the `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` reference in the right section with the project's existing pattern.
5. **Cross-reference.** Grep for the feature name across existing docs; add bidirectional references.
6. **Content audit** (when updating). Dispatch `content-auditor`; restore facts classified Missing.
7. **Information-architecture review.** Dispatch `information-architect` against the written doc; apply findability, scannability, and ordering edits.
8. **Verification.** Template followed, no placeholders, paths valid, cross-references valid, IA edits applied.

## Sources

The skill's practice is grounded in established technical-documentation convention.

### Stripe: Engineering Documentation Best Practices

Stripe's public-facing writing about the engineering-docs discipline (every reader should land with enough orientation to act, examples must be real and runnable, docs are peer-reviewed) shapes the skill's bias toward concrete examples and bidirectional cross-referencing.

### Write the Docs Community: Technical Writing Handbook

The Write the Docs community's catalog of conventions (topic-based authoring, progressive disclosure, minimalism) shaped the skill's CONDITIONAL-sections pattern and the preference for concrete paths over prose generalities.

### JoAnn Hackos: Information Development

Hackos's work on topic-based authoring and DITA concept/task/reference distinctions underlies the template's structure: an Overview section is concept, a Behavior section is task-like, Configuration and Key Files are reference.
