# Choosing a Han Plugin

*Audience: anyone about to install Han. Time to read: about two minutes. Outcome: install the right plugin on the first try, and know exactly what you got.*

> **Short answer.** Install the bundled suite with `/plugin install han@han`. That gives you everything the meta-plugin bundles: the research, analysis, and documentation skills, every agent, the planning skills (specifying, planning, sequencing, breaking down, and stress-testing work before implementation), the coding skills (writing, reviewing, analyzing, testing, investigating, and standardizing code), the GitHub skills, and the reporting skills. Pick `han.core` instead only when you know you do not want the planning, coding, GitHub, or reporting skills. There is no planning-only, coding-only, GitHub-only, or reporting-only option, because those plugins depend on the core plugin and bring it along. Some plugins sit outside the bundle: install `han.feedback` separately if you want to send feedback, `han.atlassian` separately if you want to publish documentation or feature plans to Confluence, or work items to Jira, and `han.plugin-builder` separately if you want the guidance for building your own skills, agents, and plugins.

The rest of this page explains the plugins, the one dependency that surprises people, and how to pick.

## The plugins

Han ships as a family of plugins in one marketplace. `han.core`, `han.planning`, `han.coding`, `han.github`, `han.reporting`, `han.feedback`, `han.atlassian`, and `han.plugin-builder` carry components; `han` is a convenience wrapper that bundles `han.core`, `han.planning`, `han.coding`, `han.github`, and `han.reporting`.

- **`han.core`.** The heart of the suite. It carries the research, analysis, and documentation skills, plus every agent the skills dispatch. If you install only this, you have the full set of specialists, but not the planning or coding skills: the planning skills (`/plan-a-feature`, `/plan-implementation`, `/plan-a-phased-build`, `/plan-work-items`, `/iterative-plan-review`) ship in `han.planning`, and the coding skills (`/code-review`, `/architectural-analysis`, `/investigate`, `/test-planning`, `/coding-standard`) ship in `han.coding`. See the [Skills Index](./skills/README.md) for the complete list.
- **`han.planning`.** The planning layer: the skills you reach for before implementation. It adds [`plan-a-feature`](./skills/han.planning/plan-a-feature.md), which builds a feature specification from scratch through an evidence-based interview; [`plan-implementation`](./skills/han.planning/plan-implementation.md), which turns a specification into an implementation plan through a project-manager-led team conversation; [`plan-a-phased-build`](./skills/han.planning/plan-a-phased-build.md), which splits a body of context into a sequence of independently demoable vertical-slice phases; [`plan-work-items`](./skills/han.planning/plan-work-items.md), which breaks a trusted plan into independently-grabbable, atomic work items; and [`iterative-plan-review`](./skills/han.planning/iterative-plan-review.md), which stress-tests an existing plan through codebase-grounded review passes. This plugin depends on `han.core` and is bundled by the `han` meta-plugin, so the bundled suite includes it; a core-only install does not.
- **`han.coding`.** The coding layer: the skills you reach for while working in code. It adds [`tdd`](./skills/han.coding/tdd.md), which drives a feature or behavior through a BDD-framed red-green-refactor loop and writes the tests and production code into your tree; [`refactor`](./skills/han.coding/refactor.md), which restructures existing code without changing its behavior through a test-gated refactoring loop; [`code-review`](./skills/han.coding/code-review.md), which runs a comprehensive review of the current branch or specified files; [`architectural-analysis`](./skills/han.coding/architectural-analysis.md), which assesses a module's coupling, data flow, concurrency, risk, and SOLID alignment; [`test-planning`](./skills/han.coding/test-planning.md), which produces a prioritized test plan; [`investigate`](./skills/han.coding/investigate.md), which runs an evidence-based root-cause investigation with adversarial validation of the fix; and [`coding-standard`](./skills/han.coding/coding-standard.md), which creates and updates coding standards. This plugin depends on `han.core` and is bundled by the `han` meta-plugin, so the bundled suite includes it; a core-only install does not.
- **`han.github`.** The GitHub layer. It adds the skills that talk to GitHub through the `gh` CLI: [`post-code-review-to-pr`](./skills/han.github/post-code-review-to-pr.md), which posts a code review as comments on a pull request; [`update-pr-description`](./skills/han.github/update-pr-description.md), which writes a PR description from the branch's changes; and [`work-items-to-issues`](./skills/han.github/work-items-to-issues.md), which publishes a work-items file as GitHub issues. This plugin depends on `han.core`.
- **`han.reporting`.** The reporting layer. It adds [`stakeholder-summary`](./skills/han.reporting/stakeholder-summary.md), which turns a feature specification into a plain-language stakeholder summary (also called an executive or business summary) with diagrams, for sharing with non-technical stakeholders before implementation kicks off; and [`html-summary`](./skills/han.reporting/html-summary.md), which converts that summary into a single self-contained HTML executive report. This plugin depends on `han.core`.
- **`han.feedback`.** The feedback layer. It adds [`han-feedback`](./skills/han.feedback/han-feedback.md), which captures structured post-session feedback on the Han skills you ran and optionally posts it as a GitHub issue to testdouble/han. This plugin depends on `han.core`, but it is **opt-in**: the `han` meta-plugin does not pull it in, so you install it on its own.
- **`han.atlassian`.** The Atlassian layer. It adds [`markdown-to-confluence`](./skills/han.atlassian/markdown-to-confluence.md), which publishes a local Markdown file to a Confluence location you specify; [`project-documentation-to-confluence`](./skills/han.atlassian/project-documentation-to-confluence.md), which runs the core documentation skill and then publishes the result there; [`plan-a-feature-to-confluence`](./skills/han.atlassian/plan-a-feature-to-confluence.md), which runs the `plan-a-feature` planning skill and then publishes the spec and its companion artifacts there as a page tree; and [`work-items-to-jira`](./skills/han.atlassian/work-items-to-jira.md), which creates one Jira ticket per slice from a work-items file. All work through the Atlassian MCP server. This plugin depends on `han.core`, but it is **opt-in**: the `han` meta-plugin does not pull it in, so you install it on its own. It also requires a configured Atlassian MCP server.
- **`han.plugin-builder`.** The plugin-building layer. It carries three skills: [`guidance`](./skills/han.plugin-builder/guidance.md), the authoring guidance for building Claude Code skills, agents, and plugins, which you can ask directly or — with `/guidance init` — vendor into a repo along with the two builders, plus a path-scoped rule set; [`skill-builder`](./skills/han.plugin-builder/skill-builder.md), which builds a new skill from scratch through an interview and a guidance-conformance review; and [`agent-builder`](./skills/han.plugin-builder/agent-builder.md), which does the same for a new agent. It is for people building plugins rather than shipping product features, so it is **opt-in** and depends on nothing: the `han` meta-plugin does not pull it in, and it does not bring `han.core` along.
- **`han`.** A meta-plugin with no components of its own. It exists to pull in `han.core`, `han.planning`, `han.coding`, `han.github`, and `han.reporting`. Installing it is how you ask for the bundled suite in one command. It does not bundle `han.feedback`, `han.atlassian`, or `han.plugin-builder`.

## The one thing that surprises people

`han.planning` carries only the planning skills, `han.coding` only the coding skills, `han.github` only the GitHub skills, and `han.reporting` only the reporting skills, so you might expect installing one to give you that slice of Han on its own. None of them work that way.

`han.planning`, `han.coding`, `han.github`, and `han.reporting` all depend on `han.core`. When you install a plugin that declares a dependency, Claude Code resolves and installs the dependency for you automatically and tells you what it added. So installing any of them installs `han.core` alongside it. You end up with the full set of core skills and agents either way.

That means **there is no planning-only, coding-only, GitHub-only, or reporting-only install.** The real choice comes down to:

- **Core only** (`han.core`): the research, analysis, and documentation skills, plus every agent. No planning, coding, GitHub, or reporting skills, so no `/plan-a-feature`, `/plan-implementation`, `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/architectural-analysis`, `/investigate`, `/test-planning`, or `/coding-standard`.
- **The bundled suite** (`han`): all of the above, plus the planning (`/plan-a-feature`, `/plan-implementation`, and the rest), coding (`/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/investigate`, and the rest), GitHub, and reporting skills.

Install `han` when you want the bundled suite: the `han` meta-plugin exists for exactly this, to mean "the bundled Han suite" in one command, so it is the clearest way to ask for everything it carries. The difference is also what shows up in your installed plugin list: installing `han` lists `han` and pulls its dependencies along.

`han.feedback` and `han.atlassian` sit outside that choice. Both are opt-in by design: the meta-plugin deliberately does not bundle them, so neither `han` nor `han.core` brings them in. Install `han.feedback` on its own with `/plugin install han.feedback@han` when you want to send post-session feedback to the maintainers. Install `han.atlassian` on its own with `/plugin install han.atlassian@han` when you want to publish documentation or feature plans to Confluence, or work items to Jira; it also needs a configured Atlassian MCP server. Both pull `han.core` along the same way the other layers do.

## Which one do you need?

Find the row that matches you and run the command in it. Start with the recommended option unless you have a reason not to.

| Your situation | Install | Command |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| You want everything, or you are not sure yet | **`han` (start here)** | `/plugin install han@han` |
| You want to write code test-first with `/tdd` | `han` (the bundled suite includes the coding skills) | `/plugin install han@han` |
| You work with GitHub from Claude Code (review PRs, write PR descriptions, publish work items as issues) | `han` (the bundled suite includes the GitHub skills) | `/plugin install han@han` |
| You do not need the planning, coding, GitHub, or reporting skills and want a leaner install | `han.core` | `/plugin install han.core@han` |
| You installed core only and now want the planning skills (`/plan-a-feature`, `/plan-implementation`, `/plan-a-phased-build`, `/plan-work-items`, `/iterative-plan-review`) | `han.planning` (alongside the core you already have) | `/plugin install han.planning@han` |
| You installed core only and now want the coding skills (`/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/architectural-analysis`, `/investigate`, `/test-planning`, `/coding-standard`) | `han.coding` (alongside the core you already have) | `/plugin install han.coding@han` |
| You want to send post-session feedback on Han skills to the maintainers | `han.feedback` (alongside whatever you already have) | `/plugin install han.feedback@han` |
| You want to publish Han documentation or feature plans to Confluence, or work items to Jira | `han.atlassian` (alongside whatever you already have; needs an Atlassian MCP server) | `/plugin install han.atlassian@han` |
| You are building your own skills, agents, or plugins and want the authoring guidance | `han.plugin-builder` (on its own, or alongside whatever you already have) | `/plugin install han.plugin-builder@han` |

The bundled `han` suite is the right default for almost everyone. Core-only is the deliberate choice for a reader who knows they do not want the planning, coding, GitHub, or reporting skills, for example because they do not work with GitHub from Claude Code and do not want the coding skills like `/tdd` and `/code-review`. `han.feedback` is an extra you add on top of either when you want to report back on how the skills are working for you. `han.atlassian` is an extra you add when you want documentation or feature plans published to Confluence or work items published to Jira, and it needs an Atlassian MCP server configured.

## Installing

First add the marketplace, then install the plugin you picked:

```
/plugin marketplace add testdouble/han
/plugin install han@han
```

Swap the second command for `han.core@han` if you chose core only, or name a layer plugin directly with `han.planning@han`, `han.coding@han`, `han.github@han`, `han.reporting@han`, `han.feedback@han`, `han.atlassian@han`, or `han.plugin-builder@han`. They all resolve from the same marketplace.

Adding the marketplace makes the Test Double registry visible to Claude Code so it can resolve the plugin by name; that is why it comes first. When the install finishes, Claude Code lists what it added, including any dependencies it pulled in, so you can confirm you got what you expected.

## Starting with core, adding GitHub later

Choosing `han.core` is not a one-way door. If you start with core only and later decide you want the GitHub skills, install `han.github` (or `han`) on top of what you already have. Claude Code adds the GitHub layer to the core you already installed, and you have the full suite. You do not need to uninstall or reinstall anything.
