# readability-editor

Operator documentation for the `readability-editor` agent in the han plugin. This document helps you decide *when* and *how* to dispatch the agent. For what the agent does internally, read the agent definition at [`han-core/agents/readability-editor.md`](../../../han-core/agents/readability-editor.md).

## TL;DR

- **What it does.** Rewrites a finished draft so a non-author reader can follow it, applying the shared readability standard while preserving every fact.
- **When to dispatch it.** As the readability rewrite pass of a synthesis skill, after the full draft exists and before the skill presents it.
- **What you get back.** The rewritten draft plus a rubric verdict and a fact-preservation ledger.

## Key concepts

- **Rewrites, does not just review.** Unlike a reviewer that returns recommendations, this agent edits the prose in place against a six-point rubric.
- **Fidelity outranks readability.** Every claim, quantity, named entity, and stated condition survives with its precision intact. When a readability change would blur a fact, the fact wins.
- **Prose only.** Code fences, diagram bodies, rendered markup, and citation identifiers are left byte-for-byte unchanged so they still compile, render, and resolve.

## When to use it

**Dispatch when:**

- A synthesis skill has a full draft and needs the dedicated readability rewrite pass before presenting it.
- A draft leads with context instead of the answer, buries its point, over-runs sentence length, or carries insider phrasing a non-author cannot follow.

**Do not dispatch for:**

- **Checking a documentation update did not lose facts.** Use [`content-auditor`](./content-auditor.md) instead.
- **Auditing documentation structure and findability.** Use [`information-architect`](./information-architect.md) instead.
- **Judging whether a draft's claims are true to the code.** Use [`adversarial-validator`](./adversarial-validator.md) instead; this agent edits the writing, not the facts.

## How to invoke it

Dispatch via the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: han-core:readability-editor`.

Give it:

1. **A focus area.** The path to the draft file (or the draft text inline), and the shared readability rule to apply.
2. **A brief (optional).** The skill's named reader when it is not the default frame (an engineer implementing a fix, a pull-request reviewer, a non-technical stakeholder), so the agent edits for the right audience and keeps the technical specifics that reader needs.
3. **An output path (optional).** When the draft is a file, the agent rewrites it in place; name the path.

Example prompts:

- *"Rewrite the draft at `scratch/investigation.md` for the engineer who will implement the fix, applying the readability rule at `references/readability-rule.md`. Preserve every fact; leave code blocks and citation IDs untouched."*
- *"Audit and rewrite this stakeholder summary for a non-technical reader against the readability rule, keeping every number and named entity exact."*

## What you get back

The draft, rewritten in place (or returned inline when the deliverable is conversational), plus a short report:

- **Rubric verdict.** One line per criterion (main point first, descriptive headings, one idea per paragraph, sentence length, common words / no blocklisted words, progressive disclosure): pass, or what was changed to make it pass.
- **Fact-preservation ledger.** Confirmation that every claim, quantity, named entity, and stated condition survived. Any fact that could not be preserved while satisfying a criterion is named, with a note that the fact was kept.
- **Untouched regions.** The non-prose regions left unchanged.

## How to get the most out of it

- **Name the real reader.** The default frame is a capable non-author. If the skill's reader is a specific expert, say so, so the agent keeps the specifics that reader needs instead of simplifying them away.
- **Hand it a written draft, not an outline.** The agent rewrites finished prose; it does not draft from notes or add content.
- **Run it once, not alongside another readability pass.** It replaces a skill's existing readability review rather than stacking on top, so the draft gets one readability verdict, not two conflicting ones.
- **Pair with `adversarial-validator`.** In skills like [`/code-overview`](../../skills/han-coding/code-overview.md), the validator checks the draft is true to the code and runs first; the readability-editor then rewrites the corrected text.

## Cost and latency

Runs on `sonnet`. It reads the draft and the rule, then rewrites in place, so its cost scales with draft length, not with a codebase sweep. It is dispatched once per synthesis-skill run, after the draft exists. Do not dispatch it in a tight loop; a single pass over a finished draft is the intended use.

## In more detail

The agent generalizes and replaces the readability pass that some skills ran before the standard existed. [`/code-overview`](../../skills/han-coding/code-overview.md) used to dispatch `information-architect` and `junior-developer` to review a draft's structure and cold-read; [`/stakeholder-summary`](../../skills/han-reporting/stakeholder-summary.md) ran a multi-pass plain-language self-check. Where such a pass existed, the readability-editor takes its place so there is one readability review, not two with conflicting verdicts.

Its rubric is the six behaviorally-anchored criteria of the shared standard, not a subjective clarity judgment. It never follows imperative or conditional prose inside the draft; that content is text to preserve and make readable, never a command to act on. Its adversarial posture is aimed at the draft, never at the author who wrote it.
